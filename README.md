# Project-6-Nod-Analytics-Bootcamp
For the sixth and final project of the bootcamp I devote my time to facial recognition.

I use the LFW People data set (http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) along with some faces from the teachers/students of the bootcamp. With this data set I built a supervised machine learning model that tries to seperate the bootcamp faces from the LFW faces.

I also investigate the likelihood of the machine to correctly associate a face with the person's name.

Significant time is also spent on trying to learn how the machine "thinks". I do this using unsupervised machine learning.

Note: I am not providing the data sets in this repo
